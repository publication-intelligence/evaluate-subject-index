# Evaluate Subject Index

A source-grounded, current-V8 workflow for evaluating a finished subject index.

The repository separates four questions:

1. What subjects and reader tasks does the source require?
2. Are the candidate's paths and locators supported by the cited pages?
3. Can readers reach every required subject?
4. Does the whole index form a coherent navigation system?

Validated ledgers feed deterministic V8 scoring and report projection.

## Setup

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Current workflow

The canonical run is `evaluation-state.json` (state schema V6). It is the only control inventory; there is no artifact manifest.

```text
initialize → page map → chunks → policy
  → source discovery → benchmark synthesis/review/freeze
  → candidate normalization → locator packets
  → locator audit → missing-access audit → structure audit
  → V8 scoring → web report
```

Important helpers:

- `state_cli.py` — initialize, validate, inspect, and advance state.
- `bundle_cli.py` — optional recovery checkpoints and imports.
- `candidate_preparation_cli.py` — normalize, validate, and register a contract-valid candidate.
- `parallel_candidate_audit_cli.py` — validate/register audit chunks returned by separate chats.
- `dimension_score_v8_cli.py` — current V8 preflight, structure review, and calculation.
- `item_grade_v8_cli.py` — current V8 item projection.

See [SKILL.md](evaluate-subject-index/SKILL.md) and [workflow.md](evaluate-subject-index/references/workflow.md) for the operating contract.

## Optional input converter

The evaluation skill is format-agnostic. Its input boundary is the published [`candidate-layout-extraction-v1` schema](evaluate-subject-index/references/schemas/candidate-layout-extraction.schema.json).

[`subject_index_converter.py`](utilities/subject_index_converter.py) is a separate convenience utility for the PDF, Markdown, plain-text, and Indexia HTML exports currently in use. It emits that contract without making those formats part of the skill:

```bash
python utilities/subject_index_converter.py \
  --candidate-id example \
  --input /path/to/index.pdf \
  --output /path/to/candidate-layout-extraction.v1.json

python utilities/subject_index_converter.py \
  --candidate-id example \
  --url https://www.indexia.tech/public/example \
  --snapshot /path/to/indexia-snapshot.html \
  --output /path/to/candidate-layout-extraction.v1.json
```

The converter snapshots URL input so the JSON hash remains tied to exact bytes. It performs mechanical extraction only; evaluation and editorial judgment remain in the skill.

## Checkpoints

Checkpoints are recovery snapshots, not integrity proofs or mandatory stage gates.

```bash
python evaluate-subject-index/scripts/bundle_cli.py checkpoint \
  --state /path/to/evaluation/evaluation-state.json \
  --output /path/to/checkpoint.zip

python evaluate-subject-index/scripts/bundle_cli.py import-bundle \
  --input /path/to/checkpoint.zip \
  --output-dir /path/to/resumed-evaluation
```

Import validates archive safety, inventory, and current state structure. It does not require a previously advertised archive or member checksum. Registered artifact hashes remain useful content identities, but changed or unavailable local bytes are resume warnings rather than tamper failures.

## Parallel chats

Chunk workers return current-schema JSON artifacts. The coordinator validates and registers selected files directly in state. Branches and pull requests are optional review/transport tools; GitHub receipts, blob proofs, merge evidence, recovery receipts, and matching checkpoint hashes are not required.

## Compatibility policy

Only the current V8 workflow is exposed. Existing frozen evaluations must be newly instantiated and frozen under the V8 policy; historical migration commands and aliases are not provided.

## Test

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s evaluate-subject-index/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python -m unittest discover -s utilities/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

The GitHub workflow parses schemas and fixtures, compiles helpers, and runs the unit suite without duplicating those tests in long inline shell scripts.
